# How to run

1. Make sure you have `GNU Make`, `GCC` and `mpg123` running on your `Linux` environment.

   > MacOS should work fine, but I've not tested this...

2. Download an mp3 audio file (whatever you'd like) and name it `alarm.mp3` and locate it in the `/audio` folder.

3. Finally run `make run` in the root directory

## Tests

Although this program is small there is still quite a bit of functionalty that needs to be tested. Below are four test cases that should cover must of the critical functions within the program.

### Test case #1

### Test case #2

### Test case #3

### Test case #4
